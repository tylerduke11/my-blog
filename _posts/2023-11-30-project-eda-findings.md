## Introduction and Motivation
Have you ever wondered how NBA player performance is linked to their salary? Players make a lot of money but do the best players always get paid the most? I have always had this question in my mind because theoretically, the best players should be getting paid the most. So, I decided to conduct an in-depth analysis of the data from the 2022-2023 NBA basketball season to determine if player performance is correlated with player salary. 

If you want to see a more detailed explanation of the project, such as how I quantify the "best" players, see [this](2023-11-14-semester-project.md) blog post I made at the beginning of my project.
